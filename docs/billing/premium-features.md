#### Here is what you’ll be able to do:
- 🔍 [Search through the entire content](../using/search/index.md#full-text-search) of every bookmark and PDF you’ve saved, making it extremely easy to find what you’re looking for. It's like having your personal Google.
- 💾 Create forever copies of your saved items with [Permanent Library](../using/backups/index.md#permanent-library) so you can always return to them.
- 🗄️ Group related collections within the same context by [nesting them in each other](../using/collections-groups/index.md#nested-collections).
- 🛁 Keep your bookmarks clean: find [broken](../using/filters-tags/index.md#broken-links) and [duplicate](../using/filters-tags/index.md#duplicates) links.
- 🗃️ [Upload 10 Gb files](../using/files/index.md) each month.
- 🦺 Get [automatic backups](../using/backups/index.md#automatic-backups) of your data and never worry about accidentally deleting any of your collections, bookmarks, tags, or files.
- 🏷️ Organize & filter your list with [intelligent tag suggestions](../using/filters-tags/index.md#autosuggested-tags).
