### I can't find Raindrop.io in Safari's extensions
It's known bug first seen in Safari 14. I reported it to Apple, but no reply yet.
This bug affects any extension made specificially for latest Safari 14 (completely new API).

One of our users found easy workaround:
1. Download and install Safari Technology Preview https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/
2. Open and close Safari Technology Preview
3. Now our extension should show up in regular Safari
