### I can't find Raindrop.io in Safari's extensions

</summary>

It's known bug first seen in Safari 14. I reported it to Apple, but no reply yet.
This bug affects any extension made specificially for latest Safari 14 (completely new API).

One of our users found easy workaround:
1. Download and install Safari Technology Preview https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/
2. Open and close Safari Technology Preview
3. Now our extension should show up in regular Safari

:::caution Upgrade to latest version is required!
Recently we released a new extension for Safari.
Due to some limitations it not distributed as an update, instead we released a new separate extension.
:::

Please migrate to it by following this easy steps:
1. Remove `Raindrop.io for Safari` app from `Applications` folder
2. Install new extension from [Mac App Store](https://raindrop.io/r/extension/safari)
