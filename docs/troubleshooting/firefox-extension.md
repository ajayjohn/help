### Firefox extension doesn't scroll with mouse wheel or touchpad
It's known bug first seen in Firefox 86 for macOS. I [reported it](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1694898) to Firefox developers, they working on fix.

### Extension won't load in Firefox's private mode
The Raindrop.io browser extension does not completely function in Firefoxâ€™s private browsing mode. 
This is a known issue specific only to Firefox. 
We have discussed the problem with Mozilla, however, they seem unable to fix it so that extensions like Raindrop.io can function entirely in private mode.
