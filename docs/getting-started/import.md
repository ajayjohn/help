## Supported Formats
### `HTML`
Almost any service or browser can generate this file for you. Here how to get it from popular browsers and services:
[Chrome](https://www.wikihow.com/Export-Bookmarks-from-Chrome),
[Safari](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/export-safari-bookmarks/),
[Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer),
[Pocket](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1015-exporting-your-pocket-list)

### `CSV`
We support almost any `CSV` file generated by third-party bookmarking apps.

If you want to upload your own CSV file just make sure:
- Comma delimited
- Supported columns: `url`, `folder`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, `created`
- `url` column is required, other are optional
- to have multiple `tags` just put them in quotes, like `"tag1, tag2"`
- `created` column should have Unix timestamp or date in ISO 8601 format
- Column order doesn't matter

### `TXT`
Txt file should have a url per row

### `ENEX` (Evernote)
You can transfer all your web-clips (bookmarks) from Evernote to Raindrop.io, description and tags will be imported as well.
Be sure to select `ENEX` as a file format of [export in Evernote](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-Export-notes-and-notebooks).

### `Pinterest`
Pinterest itself doesn't have any tools to export your data. But you can try to use great third-party app called [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) that can help you download export file.
Just follow instructions on [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) site.

## Settings
Before you start import, please select how much data you want to transfer:

Mode | Description
---- | -----------
**Only new folders and bookmarks** | When you upload the same import file again but with new data, this mode will prevent uploading duplicates and ensure structure untouched, only new folders and bookmarks will be imported
**Import all** | Select this mode if you want to import everything as is (including duplicates)
**Start from scratch** | This mode is the best way to clean your account data completely and replace it with data from import file. Be sure if you already have any data in Raindrop it will be removed and replaced.

## Limitations
- We support files up to 50Mb in size. If you have a larger file just archive it (as ZIP file)
- Evernote attachments are not supported yet
