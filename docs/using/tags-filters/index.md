## Tags
Tags (often called 'keywords' in other contexts) allow for detailed characterization of an item.
You can tag items based on their topics, methods, status, ratings, or even based on your own workflow (e.g., 'to-read').
Items can have as many tags as you like, and you can filter your library (or a specific collection) to show items having a specific set of one or more tags.

Raindrop.io tags are special. They allow you to name them using any characters, in any language and most importantly – with spaces.

When you click on Duplicates filter you will see only duplicate bookmarks. This list will not contain originals. So it's safe to remove them all.

> Duplicates are all that created after
