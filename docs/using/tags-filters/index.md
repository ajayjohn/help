## Tags
Tags are a great way of being able to find items when you need them & with our search tool, you can find all things tagged in one place, no matter what collection they are in.
You can search individual collections or globally, and — here’s where it gets fun — try filtering with #multiple #tags to discover interesting intersections among your items.

Raindrop.io tags are special. They allow you to name them using any characters, in any language and most importantly – with spaces.
You_wont_need_to_name_your_tags_like_that_anymore.

All of your tags are visible in the sidebar on the left of your browser.
You can click one of these and Raindrop.io will bring up all items tagged with that tag, much like a global search.

### Duplicates

</summary>

Have you ever bookmarked a page more than once? Duplicate bookmarks take up space and needlessly add to a surplus of saved pages.
Raindrop.io can help you locate and remove duplicates bookmarks.

You can find them in sidebar in Filters section:

When you click on Duplicates filter you will see only duplicate bookmarks. This list will not contain originals. So it's safe to remove them all.

> Original is bookmark that created initially, the first one  
> Duplicates are all that created after
