## Privacy & FAQ
### What permissions does the browser extension need?
Our browser extension will ask you for a few permissions after you installed it. The permissions we ask for are default permissions by your browser so we can make sure the extension works the way it should be.

### What data does the extension collect?
The browser extension does not do or collect anything unless you tell it to. It sits quietly in the background, waiting for you to interact with it.

What that means is, only if you press a button (for example: Raindrop.io) will it send a URL, or an image to the Raindrop.io servers so we can bookmark it for you. We will NEVER access anything else in your browser withour your permission and explicit action.
