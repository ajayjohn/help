When someone is added to your collection as a collaborator, they’ll be able to do everything you can do in the collection, such as adding, editing and deleting items.

If the owner of the collection is on the [Pro plan](../../billing/premium-features.md), every collaborator will also have access to the Pro features (like full-text search and permanent copies) on that collection, even if they’re not on a Pro plan.

Don’t want the person to be able to add / edit / delete items, but do want them to view your collection? [Read about permissions](#permissions) below.

## Invite a person to your collection
To invite someone to collaborate on your collection, open the collection’s settings window, then click the 'collaborators' tab. 
From here, you can manage existing collaborators or invite new ones.
To invite a new collaborator, enter their email address.

## Permissions
By default, every Raindrop.io collection you create is private and only visible to you.
You have the option to change this privacy setting to whatever suits your collection best.
You can change the privacy settings from the Collection Settings window by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner of your collection.
