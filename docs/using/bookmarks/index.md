#### Move multiple items
Start by highlighting the items that you want to copy by hovering over the items and clicking the tick mark that appears in the top left corner.
Once you have selected the items you wish to move, select ‘Move’ from the toolbar at the top of the screen.

### Change thumbnail

</summary>

When you add something, Raindrop.io will try to pull in an image from the site.
Sometimes that image doesn’t work for you; it might be a shot generated from a video that is too grainy or an image of your old boss you never want to see again.
Either way, it’s easy to change an image you hate.

To change a thumbnail of an item click on `Edit` button and then click on a thumbnail. 

If there are other images on the bookmarked webpage that Raindrop.io can pull from the site, they will be showed in grid.
Alternatively, you can upload an image that you like from your desktop by clicking on 'upload'.

### Customize appearance

</summary>

Every Raindrop.io collection is unique. Whether you add videos, images, bookmarks, files, or a combination of all of these, your collection should be easy to navigate, feel organized, and look beautiful.

On any plan you can choose view modes to fit your needs better and make your content shine: list, grid, headlines and masonry.

#### Change view mode

---

#### List
You might recognize `list`, our default view mode.
Useful information is surfaced (including who, what, and when the item was created), making it a great fit for alphabetical and date sorting.
Ideal for bookmarks, files, and list building.

---

#### Grid
Ideal for the grid-obsessed, items get cropped to clean and tidy squares. 
See your content on a level playing field (regardless of type), and drag to reorder your collection with ease. 
For the visually inclined, toggle labels off and let the thumbnails stand out.

---

#### Headlines
When thumbnails aren’t a priority, Headlines mode gives you a quick and simple way to scan your items at a glance.

---

#### Masonry
Masonry assembles your items like a jigsaw puzzle. This view is an excellent way to view mood boards or content streams where a strict order is not relevant.

---

#### Hide labels
Also, you can choose to hide labels (because sometimes images speak louder than words).
